This shader will undistort and redistort footage according to the Syntheyes model.

To use it, copy the .glsl, the .glsl.p and the .xml files somewhere where your Flame/Smoke system
can access them and load the shader into Matchbox. Afterwards, dial in the parameters computed in Syntheyes
to apply or remove distortion (the default is "remove").
